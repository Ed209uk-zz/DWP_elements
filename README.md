DWP elements guide

About this guide
----------------

These are the basic building blocks to be used for the creation of:

 - digital services used internally by DWP staff and third-party
   providers (not publicly accessible)
 -   digital services that will never be hosted on a gov.uk domain


----------


GOV.UK elements should be used wherever possible but a few things need to change, including:

 - headers & footers
 - typography (font TBC and depends on specific use)
 - layout and spacing (expert users should be able to handle denser UIs
 - the need for help and hints
